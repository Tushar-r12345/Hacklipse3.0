Vital-Heart

Problem Statement : 
• Heart disease is a major public health issue worldwide, and it is a leading cause of death and  disability. Early identification of individuals who are at high risk of developing heart disease, a well as effective treatment for those who have already been diagnosed, is crucial to improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of heart disease.

• However, identifying individuals who are at high risk of developing heart disease, as well as choosing the most effective treatment options for those who have already been diagnosed, can be challenging.
 
• There are many different factors that contribute to the development of heart disease, and the best course of treatment can vary depending on a patient's individual risk factors and medical history.

• Value of Propsition : Overall, the value proposition of heart disease and treatment prediction model is that it provides a more accurate, personalized, and cost-effective approach to identifying and treating heart disease, which is a major public health issue worldwide
I have developed a heart disease and treatment prediction model that uses data analysis and machine learning techniques to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing heart disease, as well as suggest potential treatment options based on that prediction.

Solution :

• This model has the potential to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden of heart disease by helping healthcare providers make more informed decisions about patient care.

• This model is developed on various features such as Previous history of heart disease, related medical conditions results from a cardiac computed tomography (CT) scan, Age, Chest pain, Shortness of breath, Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, Heart rate, Cholesterol levels, Diabetes, Hypertension (high blood pressure), Smoking, Obesity, Gender.

Running the program : 

• Fork the following repository.

• Install pyton on your VS Code or pycharm and if some packages or new modules are not updated , install it using using -m pip install --upgrade SomePackage.

• Install scikit libraries using pip install -U scikit-learn

• Install Flask server using pip install Flask.

• Then in server directory run server.py (it will be connected to local host).
• Then in html folder run index.html file and start exploring the project.
